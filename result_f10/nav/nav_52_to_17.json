        "description": "DGG is a deep tech company founded in 2018 starting with researching automation technology to remove an essential bottleneck in real-time 3D content creation, at the world-famous Fraunhofer institute. Having also been involved in standardization (co-creating the glTF 3D file format and working on open source initiatives), DGG co-founded the Khronos 3D Commerce group and has since then supported developers, platform partners and retailers with its RapidCompact technology that helps to upscale 3D content creation for real-time 3D and XR applications – or, as the startup’s own slogan says, “Making 3D accessible”.",
